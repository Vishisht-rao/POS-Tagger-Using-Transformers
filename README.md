# POS-Tagger-Using-Transformers

Part of Speech(POS) is a contextual categorical tag given to a word wherein words with the same POS tag contain similar grammatical and linguistically structural properties and can often replace one another in a sentence or phrase while maintaining the syntactic integrity of that sentence or phrase. Some common POS tags are noun, adjective, adverb, pronoun, verb, etc. POS Tagging is the process of assigning a POS tag to a word in any given context. Transformer architecture is an augmented form of the encoder decoder model in neural networks which brings about the concept of attention mechanism to give higher importance to certain parts of the input when compared to the other parts. This paper shows how POS tagging can be performed through the use of the transformer architecture and how it measures up to other commonly used text classification models.
